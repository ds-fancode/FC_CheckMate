#### Developer Scripts

1. To setup the checkmate application in docker with existing database of docker, to visualise the production mode behaviour
   ```sh frame="none"
   yarn docker:app:setup
   ```
   - This will create the application container in docker, and create the database container only if it is not present
2. To setup the checkmate database
   - To create database only
     ```sh frame="none"
     yarn docker:db:setup
     ```
   - To insert data in it
     ```sh frame="none"
     yarn db:init
     ```
3. Run the [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) studio to monitor your database
   ```sh frame="none"
   yarn db:studio
   ```
4. Generate sql file from the drizzle schema
   ```sh frame="none"
   yarn db:generate
   ```
   - This will generate sql file in drizzle folder at root
