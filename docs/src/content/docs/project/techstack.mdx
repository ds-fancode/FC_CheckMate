#### **RBAC**: Casbin

- Casbin is an authorization library that can be used in flows where we want a certain object or entity to be accessed by a specific user or subject. The type of access, i.e. action, can be read, write, delete, or any other action as set by the developer. This is how Casbin is most widely used, and it's called the "standard" or classic `{ subject, object, action }` flow.
